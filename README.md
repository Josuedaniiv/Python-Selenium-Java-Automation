README

This repository contains example scripts for getting started with testing using Java, Selenium, and Python. Please note that these scripts do not have a specific base project as they are intended for learning and practicing purposes.
Getting Started
Java Installation and Setup

    Visit the official Java website: https://www.oracle.com/java/
    Choose the appropriate Java Development Kit (JDK) version for your operating system.

    Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the command java -version.
    You are now ready to run Java scripts.

#Selenium Installation

    Selenium is a powerful testing framework for web applications. To install Selenium, you need to set up a project with a build automation tool like Maven or Gradle.
    Create a new project and configure the build automation tool accordingly.
    Add the Selenium dependency to your project's configuration file (e.g., pom.xml for Maven or build.gradle for Gradle).
    Update your project dependencies to download and install Selenium.
    You can now start using Selenium in your Java project for automated testing.

#Python Installation and Setup

    Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/
    Choose the latest Python version compatible with your operating system.
    Download the Python installer and run it.
    During the installation process, make sure to check the option to add Python to the system PATH.
    Verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the command python --version.
    Install the Python package manager, pip, by running the following command: python -m ensurepip --upgrade.
    You are now ready to start using Python for automated testing.

#Usage
